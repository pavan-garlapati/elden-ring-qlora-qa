    "11704": "Oh, there you are.\n Good. If you happen to see Lady Leda,\n tell her that I'm striking out on my own.\n Don't worry. I've no mind to cross any of you.\n The guidance of Kind Miquella remains etched into my very flesh.\n It's only, there's something that I must know.",
    "11705": "Kindly Miquella spoke...\n of the vow he once made with General Radahn.\n And...it is here the vow shall be honoured.\n I am a Redmane.\n I must know the nature of the vow.",

    "11708": "Oh. Hello.\n I'm afraid I'm busy.\n ...A curse upon my lack of foresight.\n I should have asked Ansbach to impart his knowledge when I had the chance.",
    "11709": "From Sir Ansbach, to me?\n What on earth could it...\n Oh...? Hmm...?\n Yes, of course, I see.\n As the festival of war concluded, General Radahn's soul met an honourable end.\n But Kindly Miquella wishes to revive it.\n ...Which is fine by me.\n I know it would pain old Jerren, but war has always suited General Radahn best.\n And certainly far more than any honourable death.\n Endless war to invigorate the soul.\n As befits General Radahn, the great lion.",
    "11710": "Thank you. Now I've finally cast off my misgivings.\n Give my regards to honourable Ansbach.\n Tell him if we should meet in battle,\n to face your bow would be fine enough, but to face your blade would be an honour.",

Miquella the Kind's enchantment appears to have broken.\n But while my devotion to Kindly Miquella remains unchanged,\n by my troth, I am not so sure about the others.\n No, wait. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\n I can wield my sword to cull the undeserving, those unfit to bask in Tender Miquella's presence.\n I should've thought of this earlier.",
    "11805": "Oh, there you are.\n I've made up my mind\u2014\n The hornsent will be eliminated.\n If he were to point his blade at Sir Messmer or Queen Marika, perhaps it would not matter.\n But vengeance changes a man.\n And one day, his blade may turn towards Miquella the Kind.\n Kindly Miquella is, after all, the true golden child.\n Even if he discards every last drop of his being,\n his lineage will always remain.",
    "11806": "Oh, there you are.\n Well fought. You have my gratitude.\n He was never going to see eye to eye with us,\n but his words were ill-founded.\n It was hard to hear, I know.",
    "11807": "Ah, there you are.\n I'm afraid Sir Ansbach will have to be next.\n He insists that he's nothing but a worn-down, over-the-hill soldier.\n But in his day, he was the feared commander of the Pureblood Knights,\n who cleaved open Miquella the Kind with his blood blade.\n He claims he hasn't the spirit to take up his sword again,\n but I doubt it'll be very long...\n Before he recalls, as I have, the cascading sheets of blood.\n I'm afraid he cannot be left to fester...",
    "11808": "Ah, there you are.\n I owe you for your help in battle, once again.\n Sir Ansbach must have considered it an honourable end, being felled by your hand.\n After all, the good fellow held you in the highest regard.\n When we speak of it, we may speak with pride\u2014that we were Sir Ansbach's final adversaries.",
    "11809": "You are an odd one, aren't you.\n The enchantment is broken, and yet you alone appear completely unchanged.\n As if nothing was ever cast upon you.\n ...\n No matter.\n If you found your way here, it was because Kindly Miquella wished it so.\n But I am afraid this is our farewell.\n When next we meet, let it be under the eyes of Miquella the Kind.\n Good bye, comrade.",
    "11810": "Ah, I thought I'd see you here.\n It's been quite some time.\n ...\n It was never Kindly Miquella, was it? The Erdtree was leading you all along.\n So that you might ascend to lordship.\n Why come to these lands to begin with?\n I suppose it must be what his Eminence, or perhaps the Erdtree, desired all along?\n The clashing of the favoured lords, such that one would prevail?\n So be it.\n If you insist upon facing Miquella the Kind,\n Then I will run you through, whoever you might be.\n Don't tarry now.",
    "11811": "Worthy hornsent. I will dispose of you.\n Before your thirst for revenge beckons our undoing.\n I can no longer trust your word.",
    "11812": "Sir Ansbach. I will dispose of you.\n I find that I have a new apprehension\u2014\n Your ambivalence. And exactly where it might lead you...",
    "11813": "Don't you dare approach Miquella the Kind.\n Needle Knight Leda, Dryleaf Dane, and our allies...\n Will never allow this.\n Will never allow this.",
    "11890": "",
    "11901": "Oh, hello there.\n Are you the Tarnished?\n Lady Leda spoke of you.\n Another Tarnished, guided here by Miquella the Kind.\n My name is Thiollier.\n I, too, am Tarnished, and here on Kindly Miquella's account.\n So, well...\n Here's to new beginnings, I suppose.",
    "11902": "Um, I'm sorry...\n But, well, I'm not much good at anything, is all.\n I'm as weak as a kitten and thick as two planks.\n I've always been this way...since the very day I was born.\n I'm afraid the only thing I\u2019m proficient in is...is poison...\n Sorry...",
    "11903": "Is that so?\n Then take this.\n This concoction can coax even the oldest of dragons to sleep.\n For you, it will grant the sweetest slumber...\n ...for all eternity.",
    "11904": "Oh, umm...\n Are you not affected? Even with the spell broken?\n I'm feeling rather lost. Haunted by memories.\n Of St. Trina. Her visage. Her scent. The lure of velvety sleep.\n Would Kindly Miquella chasten me?\n For falling for St. Trina, while knowing that she was the discarded half?\n The problem is...I simply cannot help it.\n I would sacrifice everything, just to gaze upon her, one last time.",
    "11905": "Umm, oh...\n I had something I wish to tell you.\n I'm heading south.\n I've recalled something that Sir Moore said.\n He discovered deep-purple water lilies blooming on the southern shore.\n That must be where St. Trina was left to wither away.",
    "11906": "Are...are you certain of this?\n Is this all a plot to make a mockery of me?\n ...\n Oh, heavens, what am I saying. Forgive me.\n You deserve my deepest gratitude.\n I will make the journey.\n To the southern coast, as you say. To venture into the depths of the fissure.",
    "11907": "St. Trina...\n Oh, St. Trina...\n What velvety ambrosia is this?\n Your poison, and the sweet sleep that follows.\n Oh, please, let me hear your voice...",
    "11908": "Ah, hello.\n Thank you for your help.\n Without it, I wouldn't have seen St. Trina again.\n I'm drifting off in the sea of her poison.\n Soon, I will hear her voice.\n Let me be. I won't be long.",
    "11909": "Oh, I almost forgot.\n You mustn't follow my example.\n St. Trina's poison would plunge you into an eternal slumber.\n It must be me, and only me.",
    "11910": "I'll thank you not to lie to me.\n I am the chosen, not you.\n Only I can doze off in the sea of St. Trina.\n Why would you hear her voice, when I cannot?\n If you should utter these cruel untruths to me again I...\n I won't be held responsible for my actions...",
    "11911": "Please, enough.\n I cannot believe your cheek.\n And I will stand for it no longer!",
    "11912": "Ah, you...\n I was no good to anyone, beginning to end.\n Weak as a kitten and thick as two planks.\n I suppose dying in disgrace is fitting, in a way...\n Ha...ha...\n Tell me, please.\n Assuming you spoke the truth back then...\n What did St. Trina tell you?",
    "11913": "Ahh, you are a wretched, wretched soul...\n A nightmare, come to plague me.\n Such a thing...couldn't possibly be...\n Could it? St. Trina.\n Please, let me hear your voice.\n In my everlasting slumber...",
    "11914": "I will never forgive you.\n For your trespass, you will know my poison...",
    "11915": "Never utter these untruths again.\n St. Trina would never say such things.",
    "11916": "Why did you mislead me?\n Such strength, but for what...",
    "11917": "I am here to serve St. Trina, evermore.",
    "11918": "I am deeply sorry. For doubting you.\n I am here only to grant St. Trina's singular wish.\n I will stop Miquella the Kind.\n He will never become a god.",
    "11919": "Not the finest blade, nor the mightiest armour...\n will spare your life. From the poison of Thiollier.",
    "11920": "Sir Moore. I do not wish to fight you.\n But I have new purpose I must see through.",
    "11921": "You have no understanding.\n Of Kind Miquella. Of St. Trina's love...",
    "11922": "I am here to serve St. Trina, evermore.",
    "11923": "Sorry. It's up to you now.\n Grant St. Trina's one wish.",
    "11924": "...Ahhh...",
    "11990": "",
    "12001": "Well. We don't often receive visitors.\n I am Ymir. Welcome, to Manus Metyr.\n It is a pleasure to have you.\n In lands so forsaken as these, chance encounters are precious indeed.\n Seeing that we have convened here on this day,\n allow me to mark the occasion with a modest offering.",

Is that not sublime?\n ...and yet, none can fathom its implications, its utter brilliance!",

Their bitter suffering.\n Is there no hope for redemption?\n The answer, sadly, is clear.\n There never was any hope. They were each of them defective. Unhinged, from the start.\n Marika herself. And the fingers that guided her.\n And this is what troubles me.\n No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten,\n ...then we have little recourse.",
    "12009": "Ever-young Miquella saw things for what they were.\n He knew that his bloodline was tainted. His roots mired in madness.\n A tragedy if ever there was one.\n That he would feel compelled to renounce everything.\n When the blame...lay squarely with the mother.",

Hello there.\n I heard another sound, coloured by your essence.\n Simply exhilarating, I must say.\n The stars are dark tonight.\n But rest assured, this is no ill omen.\n On the contrary. I believe that this portends a magnificent starry cascade.\n Now, take this, my final gift to you.\n May you join the glimmering stars above.",
    "12011": "Do you recall what I said?\n That Marika, and the fingers that guided her, were unsound from the start.\n Well, the truth lies deeper still.\n It is their mother who is damaged and unhinged.\n The fingers are but unripe children. Victims in their own right.\n We all need a mother, do we not?\n A new mother, a true mother, who will not give birth to further malady.",
    "12012": "Forgive me.\n I failed you. Failed to birth you whole.\n But it won't be long now.\n I will soon be a mother. I will give you new life.\n I assure you, you will have life.",
